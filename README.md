# Chronic Lymphotic Leukemia dataset

Dataset with indicator for supervised learning. Indicator 0 means patient needs another laboratory examination and indicator 1 means this examination can be delayed because health condition has improved.



## Phase 1 - EDA (exploratory data analysis)

#### Description and analysis of the data.

#### Hypothesis testing

After all tests done we can reject H0 (Average trombocytes are the same for patients with worsened conditions) in favor of H1 - Average trombocytes are higher for patient with worsened conditions.

## Phase 2 - Data preprocessing, feature selection





## Phase 3 - Machine learning models
